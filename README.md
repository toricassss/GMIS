# GROUP MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (GMIS)
## KIT506 GROUP 12
## System Overview

### This system will provide students with the wherewithal to find out about group meetings outside of class time and to find out when other students in their groups are available for ad hoc project meetings.  At this high level, conceptual stage, the diagrams in this document model how a user can add themselves to a group and enter the group meeting time for each unit.  Using their basic information and a photo, students will be able to add themselves to an existing group or to create a new group with themselves in it.  The information that they provide is used to display all out of hours contact times for students and groups so that they may more effectively schedule their time.  This project, which has been modelled using Star UML, will ultimately incorporate both textual and image information and deliver it through a single Windows application.
